<p>Our First Project was pretty basic.My first project was on Code.org where I learned the basics of creating a minecraft game. The coding was a drag and drop. So we had different commands on the right side of the screen, and a empty box on the left side where we dragged commands like move forward, or turn left or right to make the player move. There was a total of 14 levels and once you got to 14 you had to create your own.

<p>AgentCubes is a programming environment that gets us started immediately with our intuitive, visual, built-in programming tools. Guided by Mr. Nick when needed, we created characters and worlds and program their behaviors with a drag and drop interface. We had to program a Frogger game with 3D characters.</p>

<p>We learned the basics of HTML which is an Hyper Text Markup Language and used Sublime Text or Atom to create a dynamic webpage. Many things we've learned were how to change the colors and font in the text, background colors and inserting logos and active navigation buttons.</p>
